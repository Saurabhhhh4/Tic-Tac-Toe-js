Key Components
DOM Elements:

boxes: All grid cells (9 boxes in a 3x3 grid).

resetBtn / newGameBtn: Buttons to reset the game.

msgContainer / msg: Displays the winner/draw message.

Game Logic:

turnO: Tracks whose turn it is (O starts first).

count: Tracks moves to detect a draw.

winPatterns: All possible winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals).

Core Functions
resetGame():

Resets the game state (turns, count, re-enables boxes, hides messages).

Event Listeners for Boxes:

When a box is clicked:

Marks it with O or X based on turnO.

Disables the box to prevent reuse.

Checks for a winner or draw after each move.

checkWinner():

Iterates through winPatterns to see if any winning combination has the same symbol (O/X).

Calls showWinner() if a winner is found.

gameDraw():

Triggers when all 9 boxes are filled (count === 9) with no winner.

disableBoxes() / enableBoxes():

Disable/enable interaction with grid cells (used when the game ends or resets).

Workflow
Player Turn:

Players alternate placing O and X by clicking boxes.

Win/Draw Check:

After each move, checkWinner() scans for winning patterns.

If no winner after 9 moves, gameDraw() is called.

Reset/New Game:

Clicking resetBtn or newGameBtn resets the board and variables.

Key Observations
Winning Logic: Uses pre-defined winPatterns (e.g., [0, 1, 2] for the top row).

Draw Detection: Tracks moves via count to detect when the grid is full.

UI Updates: Shows/hides messages and toggles box states (enabled/disabled).

Potential Improvements
Code Duplication: The commented-out section at the end is redundant and should be removed.

Styling: The CSS classes (e.g., hide) are not shown but are critical for UI behavior.

Edge Cases: Ensure the game handles simultaneous win/draw conditions correctly (e.g., a win on the 9th move).

This is a classic implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe, ideal for learning DOM manipulation and game logic in JavaScript. ðŸŽ®
